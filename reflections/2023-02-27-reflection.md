# [2023-02-27] Reflection & Feelings

## Reflecting on Each Hour of Learning
As I work to learn Go, I want to make sure I'm making steady progress and retaining the knowledge I'm gaining. To help me achieve this, I plan to reflect on each hour of learning by asking myself the following questions:

1. **What new concept or feature did I learn today?**

    Basicailly how to create a web server using built in go librarlies. How to encode and decode JSON objects. Versy basics of how to control program flow using switch statents ifs and loops. Basically I am able to create simple API with persitance in memory. 

2. **What was challenging about the concept or feature I learned?**

    Using and finding standard libs. 

3. **What code examples or exercises did I work on today?** 

    Web server 

4. **How can I apply what I learned today to my future coding projects?**

    I should be able to create very simple API for personal project. It's also a good stepping stone for the future.


5. **What questions do I still have about the concept or feature I learned?**

    I still don;t understand when I should return pointer and when I should return value. Also i should take time to do more reading on the standard library. 


## Measuring My Feelings

To measure my feelings about my learning journey, I could ask myself the following questions:

1. **Am I feeling motivated and engaged in my learning?**

    Yes

2. **Am I feeling challenged by the material?**

    Syntax and paradigm is def. challenging. Simple API is not :) 

3. **Am I feeling confident in my understanding of the material?**

    Yes I do 

4. **Am I feeling supported in my learning journey?**
    
    Yes

5. **Am I feeling satisfied with my progress?**
    Yes. really happy to be consistent and have a whole week of daily practice.
