# [$DATE$] Reflection & Feelings

## Reflecting on Each Hour of Learning
As I work to learn Go, I want to make sure I'm making steady progress and retaining the knowledge I'm gaining. To help me achieve this, I plan to reflect on each hour of learning by asking myself the following questions:

1. **What new concept or feature did I learn today?**

    *This question will help me reflect on the key takeaways from my learning session and ensure that I am making progress towards my overall learning goals.*


2. **What was challenging about the concept or feature I learned?**

    *This question will help me identify areas where I may need to spend more time practicing or seek out additional resources to reinforce my understanding.*

3. **What code examples or exercises did I work on today?** 

    *This question will help me track my progress and ensure that I am actively practicing my coding skills.*

4. **How can I apply what I learned today to my future coding projects?**

    *This question will help me think about how the new concepts or features I learned can be integrated into real-world coding projects, and help me stay motivated to continue learning.*


5. **What questions do I still have about the concept or feature I learned?**

    *This question will help me identify areas where I may need to do additional research or seek out help from other developers to deepen my understanding.*


## Measuring My Feelings

To measure my feelings about my learning journey, I could ask myself the following questions:

1. **Am I feeling motivated and engaged in my learning?**

    *This question will help me assess whether I am enjoying my learning journey and staying motivated to continue exploring Go.*

2. **Am I feeling challenged by the material?**

    *This question will help me assess whether I am pushing myself to learn new concepts and skills that are stretching my abilities.*

3. **Am I feeling confident in my understanding of the material?**

    *This question will help me assess whether I am retaining the knowledge I am gaining and able to apply it to practical coding projects.*

4. **Am I feeling supported in my learning journey?**
    
    *This question will help me assess whether I have the resources and support I need to continue learning Go, such as access to helpful online communities or experienced mentors.*

5. **Am I feeling satisfied with my progress?**
    *This question will help me assess whether I am making steady progress towards my learning goals and feeling a sense of accomplishment as I build my skills and knowledge of Go.*
