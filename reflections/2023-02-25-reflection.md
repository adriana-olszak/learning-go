# [2023-02-25] Reflection & Feelings

## Materials used in today's session

Today was a bit different; instead of continuing with the course, I spent time adding more structure to the learning process. From now on, I will include notes and reflections for each day. Notes & Reflections questions are generated using ChatGPT.

## Reflecting on Each Hour of Learning

As I work to learn Go, I want to make sure I'm making steady progress and retaining the knowledge I'm gaining. To help me achieve this, I plan to reflect on each hour of learning by asking myself the following questions:

1. **What new concept or feature did I learn today?**

    I learned how dates are formatted in Go and that `2006-01-02` is not just some random string üòÖ. I had to use a small `reflection/generate.go` script that I wrote to help keep up with those notes.

2. **What was challenging about the concept or feature I learned?**

    Nothing really. It was more surprising that it works that way.

3. **What code examples or exercises did I work on today?** 

    I wrote a small script `reflection/generate.go` to generate a file based on a template.

4. **How can I apply what I learned today to my future coding projects?**

    Scripts are always useful to write. Reading data from a disk is also useful, not often used in such a manner in a Web App but as part of dev automation.

5. **What questions do I still have about the concept or feature I learned?**

    How to operate on dates and how exactly the standard libs that I used work. A lot to learn.

## Measuring My Feelings

To measure my feelings about my learning journey, I could ask myself the following questions:

1. **Am I feeling motivated and engaged in my learning?**

    Yeah! Go looks fun üëç

2. **Am I feeling challenged by the material?**

    Today was chill.

3. **Am I feeling confident in my understanding of the material?**

    üëå

4. **Am I feeling supported in my learning journey?**
    
    As always, I have dev colleagues that are there for me if I need help.

5. **Am I feeling satisfied with my progress?**

    Yep, progressing steadily.
